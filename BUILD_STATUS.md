## Automated Builds

[![Build OpenWrt IPK](https://github.com/username/ispapp-cwmpclient/actions/workflows/build-ipk.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/username/ispapp-cwmpclient/actions/workflows/build-ipk.yml)
[![Dev Build](https://github.com/username/ispapp-cwmpclient/actions/workflows/dev-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/username/ispapp-cwmpclient/actions/workflows/dev-build.yml)

## Quick Start

### Build for OpenWrt (Linux)
```bash
# Using the wrapper Makefile
make ipk ARCH=x86_64

# Or directly with script
./scripts/build-ipk.sh --arch x86_64
```

### Build for macOS ARM64
```bash
# Using the wrapper Makefile  
make macos

# Or directly with script
./scripts/build-macos.sh
```

### Build All Architectures
```bash
make ipk-all
```

## Available Build Targets

Run `make help` to see all available targets, or see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for detailed documentation.

## Architecture Support

| Platform | Architectures | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| OpenWrt | mips_24kc, mipsel_24kc, arm_cortex-a7, arm_cortex-a53, aarch64, x86_64 | ✅ Full Support |
| macOS | ARM64 (Apple Silicon) | ✅ Native Build |
| Linux | x86_64 development builds | ✅ Supported |

## Continuous Integration

- **Main Workflow**: Builds all supported architectures on push/PR
- **Dev Workflow**: Manual builds for testing specific architectures
- **Release Workflow**: Automatic asset publishing on releases

## Getting Started

1. **Check prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   make check-tools
   ```

2. **Setup development environment**:
   ```bash
   make setup-dev
   ```

3. **Build for your platform**:
   ```bash
   # OpenWrt
   make ipk ARCH=your_architecture
   
   # macOS
   make macos
   ```

For detailed build instructions, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).
